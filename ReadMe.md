				#Indian-Sign-Language-Interpretation-using-Camera
Our Project presents the early findings of an exploration in to the suitability of a range sensing camera for recognising Indian Sign Language. A camera is an optical instrument for recording images, which may be stored locally, transmitted to another location, or both. The images may be individual still photographs or sequences of images constituting videos or movies. The functioning of the camera is very similar to the functioning of the human eye.
The camera is a device which is easily available and has an adequate level of accuracy in producing a system which could be used to recognise Indian signs. This functionality could then be incorporated into a system to help young deaf and hard of hearing children to learn Indian signs. The system would be able to demonstrate specific signs using videos and images, and provide feedback to the child on its own about their Indian Sign accuracy through the application developed. This project is aimed specifically for Indian Sign Language and the principles will be relevant to any sign based communication system.
